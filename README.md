# mpu6050-dmp-ros-raspberry
This repository enhances a Raspberry Pi's ability to communicate with an MPU6050 sensor over I2C/smbus, focusing on harnessing the sensor's DMP for ROS message publication. It's an extension of [thisisG's MPU6050-I2C-Python-Class](https://github.com/thisisG/MPU6050-I2C-Python-Class), adding ROS compatibility. It's tailored for integrating MPU6050 sensor data in ROS robotics projects.
